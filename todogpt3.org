* can you write a simple web app in OCaml?
  Yes, it is possible to write a simple web app in OCaml. OCaml is a
  programming language that is well-suited for web development, with a
  powerful type system and support for many popular web development
  frameworks and libraries.

  To write a simple web app in OCaml, you will need to have a basic
understanding of the language and be familiar with the OCaml syntax
and features. You will also need to have a web server, such as Apache
or Nginx, installed and configured on your system.

To create a web app in OCaml, you can start by defining the structure
of your app using an OCaml module. This can include defining the data
types and values that your app will use, as well as any functions and
procedures that will be needed.

Next, you can use the OCaml standard library or a web development
framework, such as OCaml-CoHTTP or Ocsigen, to handle the HTTP
requests and responses for your app. This can include defining routes
and handling requests for different URLs, as well as generating and
serving HTML or other content to the user's web browser.

Once your app is complete, you can compile and run it on your web
server to test and use it. With a bit of effort and practice, you can
create a simple but functional web app using OCaml.

* i don't understand the code. can you walk me through to help figure it out
Certainly. This code is a simple todo app written in OCaml using the
OCaml-CoHTTP web development framework. The app allows the user to add
todo items and mark them as completed.

The code defines a TodoApp module that contains all the functions and
data for the app. The todo type is defined as a record containing an
id, text, and completed field. This is used to represent each
individual todo item.

The todos value is a reference to a list of todo items. This is used
to store the current state of the todo list.

The add_todo function is used to add a new todo item to the list. It
takes the text of the todo as an argument and creates a new todo
record with the given text and an id that is one greater than the
current number of todos. It then prepends the new todo to the list of
todos.

The complete_todo function is used to mark a todo as completed. It
takes the id of the todo as an argument and updates the corresponding
todo record in the list of todos by setting the completed field to
true.

The todo_html function is used to generate the HTML for a single todo
item. It takes a todo record as an argument and returns a string
containing the HTML for the todo. The HTML includes the todo text and
a link to mark the todo as completed.

The todo_list_html function is used to generate the HTML for the
entire todo list. It takes a list of todo records as an argument and
returns a string containing the HTML for the list. This HTML consists
of the individual todo items generated by the todo_html function,
concatenated together.

The todo_page_html function is used to generate the HTML for the
entire todo app page. It takes a list of todo records as an argument
and returns a string containing the HTML for the page. This HTML
includes the form for adding new todos, the todo list generated by the
todo_list_html function, and some CSS styles for styling the page.

Finally, the callback function is the main handler for HTTP requests
to the app. It takes the connection conn_id, the request, and the body
as arguments. It then matches on the path of the request to determine
which action to take.

If the path is "/", then the app returns the todo app page by calling
the todo_page_html function and passing the current list of todos.

If the path is a number, then the app assumes that the user is trying
to mark a todo as completed. It parses the path as an int and calls
the complete_todo function with that id.

If the request method is POST, then the app assumes that the user is
trying to add a new todo. It extracts the todo text from the request
body and calls the add_todo function with that text.

In all other cases, the app returns a 404 error.

Overall, this code provides a simple but functional todo app that
allows the user to add and complete todo items using a web browser.
